Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by
each student. Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges,
then sort the result by hacker_id. If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created,
then exclude those students from the result.

WITH challenge_counts AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT
        h.hacker_id,
        h.name,
        COUNT(c.challenge_id) OVER(PARTITION BY c.hacker_id) AS num_challenges
    FROM
        Hackers h JOIN Challenges c ON h.hacker_id = c.hacker_id
), max_challenge_count AS (
    SELECT MAX(num_challenges) AS maxn
    FROM challenge_counts
), duplicate AS (
    SELECT num_challenges AS dups_num_chal
    FROM challenge_counts
    GROUP BY num_challenges
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
SELECT
    *
FROM
    challenge_counts
WHERE
    num_challenges = (SELECT maxn FROM max_challenge_count)
    OR
    num_challenges NOT IN (SELECT dups_num_chal FROM duplicate)
ORDER BY
    num_challenges DESC,
    hacker_id
