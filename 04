-- Given is user login table for , identify dates where a user has logged in for 5 or more consecutive days.
-- Return the user id, start date, end date and no of consecutive days, sorting based on user id.
-- If a user logged in consecutively 5 or more times but not spanning 5 days then they should be excluded.
